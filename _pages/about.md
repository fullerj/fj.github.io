I am a Ph.D. Student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Dr. Brendan Saltaformaagio](https://saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu/) in the [Cyber Forensics Innovation (CyFi) Lab](https://cyfi.ece.gatech.edu/). My research interests lie in cyber attack forensics, web and IoT security, and malware analysis. 

My current research aims to combine advanced program analysis techniques and large-scale measurements to explore new methods that target botnet disruptions and takedowns. In fact, my work on C3PO revealed that approximately 1 in 3 malware use one or more over-permissioned protocols which expose a scalable opportunity for covert monitoring of C&C servers through protocol infiltration, a fundamental enable of botnet disruptions and takedowns. 

Before joining Georgia Tech, I worked as a Network Systems, where I engineered, operated, and secured the Department of Defense (DoD) information networks and services.

My CV is available upon request.
