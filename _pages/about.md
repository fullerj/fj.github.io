I am a PhD Student in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Dr. Brendan Saltaformaagio](https://saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu/) in the [Cyber Forensics Innovation (CyFi) Lab](https://cyfi.ece.gatech.edu/). My research interests lie in cyber attack foresnics, web and IoT security, and malware analysis. My current reseach aims to combine advanced program analysis techniques and large-scale measurements to explore new techniques that target botnet disruptions and take downs.
